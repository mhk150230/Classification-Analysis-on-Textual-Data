# Classification Analysis on Textual Data

Statistical classification refers to the task of identifying a category, from a predefined set, to which a data point belongs, given a training data set with known category memberships. Classification differs from the task of clustering, which concerns grouping data points with no predefined category memberships, where the objective is to seek inherent structures in data with respect to suitable measures. Classification turns out as an essential element of data analysis, especially when dealing with a large amount of data. In this project, we look into different methods for classifying textual data.
In this project, the goal includes:

1. To learn how to construct tf-idf representations of textual data.

2. To get familiar with various common classification methods.

3. To learn ways to evaluate and diagnose classification results.

4. To learn two dimensionality reduction methods: PCA & NMF.

5. To get familiar with the complete pipeline of a textual data classification task.
